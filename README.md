# Epic Move

For an early stage start-up, it's hard to beat the speed of delivery,
operational off-loading, and agility that Amazon Web Services makes possible.
But as some enterprises grow, there comes a critical point where those early
benefits can all too quickly transform what was once the backbone of your
minimum viable product into a super massive black hole sucking in all of your
funding and driving your run rate through the roof. Join us for a glimpse into
the motivations, false starts, successes, and lessons encountered by the Datto
engineering team in their continuing mission to save the Backupify SAAS
application from the brink of the AWS event horizon. A mission that would
ultimately entail the creation of one of the world's largest OpenStack Swift
clusters and the migration of more than 10 petabytes of data and a host of
distributed services including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Cassandra.
