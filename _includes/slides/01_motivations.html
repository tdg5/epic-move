  <h3>A Rough Timeline</h3>
  <p>December 10th, 2014: Datto acquires Backupify</p>
  <p>Nanoseconds later: Holy Hell, we need to get the f*** out of AWS</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Unsustainable Costs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Hundreds of EC2 Instances
      <ul>
        <li>Typically larger, more expensive instance types</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      4 petabytes of data in S3
      <ul>
        <li>That's more than 4 million gigabytes</li>
        <li>Skyrocketed to more than 10PB by the time migrations began</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How did we get here?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Minimizing vendor lock-in has its costs
      <ul>
        <li>
          Very minimal dependency on other AWS services (other than EC2 &amp; S3)
        </li>
        <li>
          Trade-off: takes compute and operational knowledge to roll your own
        </li>
        <li><em>Forget yee not:</em> <strong>compute = money</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>How did we get here?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Early assumptions / design decisions didn't work out
      <ul>
        <li>No process of data de-duplication</li>
        <li>Dead data most often "deleted" by throwing encryption keys away</li>
        <li>Manual and cumbersome process to delete dead block storage</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Atypical usage patterns
      <ul>
        <li>A few outliers can turn a strained situation into a full blown
        nightmare</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
