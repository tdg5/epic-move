  <h2>Phase 2: Prepare</h2>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Optimize the network</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You're now dealing with at least 2 distinct networks
      <ul><li>Repeat optimizations as necessary</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you use a VPC, figure out your cross-cloud communication strategy
      <ul>
        <li>VPN? Tunneling?</li>
        <li>Consider the implications of this choice</li>
        <li>SSL termination can take a good deal of RAM and CPU</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Upgrade now</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Get started on any necessary upgrades early to mitigate complications,
      complexity, and scaling requirements that occur when upgrading while migrating
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>So Many Metrics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find metrics that provide confidence that the current plan is the right
      plan
    </li>
    <li>
      Find metrics to prevent the migration process from obscuring visibility
      into the overall health of the application
      <ul>
        <li>
          These metrics will also help prevent the migration from becoming a
          scapegoat for unrelated system problems
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Does your monitoring infrastructure support multiple clouds?
    </li>
  </ul>
