  <h2>Phase 0: Research</h2>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Understand your situation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Get a sense of your various growth rates
      <ul>
        <li>Service growth rates and costs should inform order of attack</li>
        <li>Different strategies required when growth outpaces migration</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      How do you define "done"?
      <ul>
        <li>When everything has been migrated?</li>
        <li>
          When the cost of migrating outweighs the return?
          <ul><li>75% of the work will get you 90% of the benefit</li></ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Know your bottlenecks and trouble services
      <ul>
        <li>Optimize where possible</li>
        <li>Be prepared to wait</li>
        <li>Be prepared to work around these systems</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h3>Consider alternatives to migration</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>S3 Infrequent Access storage</li>
    <li>Amazon Glacier</li>
    <li>Amazon Snowball Import/Export service</li>
    <li>Retrieve 3rd party data again</li>
    <li>
      Do you <strong>really</strong> need all the data?
      <ul>
        <li>Even a data backup company found extraneous data</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Replacements and Upgrades</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Replacing AWS services will be harder than you expect
      <ul><li>Start researching and vetting replacements ASAP</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Determine what needs to be upgraded now
      <ul>
        <li>
          More recent versions tend to have better migration capabilities which
          may affect your design
        </li>
        <li>Separate upgrades from migrations where possible</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>S3 clones != S3</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Test your S3 replacement of choice early and often
      <ul><li>Test both egress scale and steady-state scale</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure S3 replacement will support your dataset's:
      <ul>
        <li>partitioning strategy</li>
        <li>typical file sizes</li>
        <li>total number of files</li>
        <li>total amount of storage</li>
        <li>API dependencies</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Remember: data replication is now your responsibility</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Timing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Identify biggest contributors to current and future costs and start there
    </li>
    <li>
      Alternatively, focus on data that will yield greatest return for least
      effort
    </li>
    <li>
      Get service upgrades started early
    </li>
    <li>
      Find replacement services &mdash; depending on how you've abused AWS,
      finding replacements may take time
    </li>
    <li>
      The migration will take time, so start development there and focus on next
      steps once migration is underway
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider building out several options simultaneously at the start in case
      some strategies work out better than others or don't work out at all
    </li>
  </ul>
