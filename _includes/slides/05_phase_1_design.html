  <h3>Keep It Simple, Stupid</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Avoid temptation to complicate migration to solve outstanding problems
      <ul>
        <li>Don't overlook impact of tech debt on speed, ease, and agility</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prefer what is simple over what is easy</li>
    <li>
      Minimize the number of variables whenever possible
      <ul>
        <li>Handle upgrades separately (e.g. Cassandra 1.2 -&gt; Cassandra 2.2)</li>
        <li>Handle internal service substitutions separately (VPC -&gt; stunnel)</li>
        <li>Handle environment substitutions separately (VM -&gt; Docker)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prefer incremental progress as opposed to depending on completion</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Keep A Record What and Why</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is obvious today won't be obvious next week (much less next year)</li>
    <li>The human brain is not deterministic</li>
    <li>
      Other teams/engineers coming onto the project will better understand the
      history of decisions and the impact of those decisions
      <ul>
        <li>History of the migration is more important than you realize when it
        comes time to debug</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reduce the chance of everyone forgetting some minor but critical detail</li>
    <li>Things change</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Beware egress costs!</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit extraneous egress to save $$$</li>
    <li>Running some tasks on EC2 compute may be more affordable</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Verifying the data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Decide how you're going to audit the data up front</li>
    <li>Don't underestimate the confidence required to actually delete data</li>
    <li>Likely a task worth running on EC2 compute</li>
    <li>
      Reduce how much of the data is audited over time
      <ul>
        <li>Always audit some of the data so regressions can be detected</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Deleting the data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Consider relationship between audits and deletions
      <ul>
        <li>Delete each item as audited?</li>
        <li>Delete each bucket after fully audited?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Prefer strategies that allow you to delete data item by item rather than
      bucket by bucket, incremental &gt; all at once on completion
    </li>
    <li>Don't underestimate the confidence required to actually delete data</li>
    <li>
      Figure out what sort of safety window is needed before a delete becomes
      permanent if you're auditing less than all the data
    </li>
  </ul>
